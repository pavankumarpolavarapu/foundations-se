### The Guiding Theory: The CAP Theorem

Before we get to the principles, we have to talk about the "rule" that forces this trade-off. It's called the **CAP Theorem**. It's a foundational idea for any distributed system (i.e., any system that runs on more than one computer).

The CAP Theorem states that a distributed database can only provide **two** of the following three guarantees:

1.  **C - Consistency:** Every read receives the most recent write or an error. In simpler terms, all users see the same data at the same time. (This is the 'C' from ACID).
2.  **A - Availability:** Every request receives a (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write. In simpler terms, the system is always up and running and will answer you.
3.  **P - Partition Tolerance:** The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes. In simpler terms, it keeps working even if one data center can't talk to another.

**The Big Rule:** For any large-scale, modern web service, a network partition (**P**) is a fact of life. It *will* happen. Therefore, you **must** design for it. This forces a choice between Consistency (C) and Availability (A).

*   **ACID databases** (like PostgreSQL) often choose **Consistency** over Availability (CP). If there's a network partition, they might refuse to respond until they are sure they can do so consistently.
*   **NoSQL databases** (like Cassandra, MongoDB, DynamoDB) almost always choose **Availability** over strict Consistency (AP). They will always answer a request, even if it means the data they return is slightly out of date (stale).

This choice leads to a different set of principles, known as **BASE**.
