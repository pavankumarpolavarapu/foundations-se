### Principle 1: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

This is the easiest to understand and one of the most important.

*   **What it is:** The DRY principle states that "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system."
*   **In Plain English:** **Don't copy and paste code.** If you find yourself writing the exact same logic in two or more places, you should stop and turn that logic into a reusable component, like a function or a class.

**Why it's a big deal:**
Imagine you have a piece of code that calculates a student's final grade, and you've copied it into 5 different places in your application. Now, the university decides to change the grading policy. You have to hunt down all 5 of those copies and change them. If you miss one? You've introduced a nasty bug.

**The DRY Way:** You write a single function called `calculateFinalGrade()`. You then call that function from all 5 places. When the policy changes, you only have to update that one function. Simple, safe, and efficient.

**Example (JavaScript):**

```javascript
// --- BAD: WET Code (Write Everything Twice) ---
function displayStudentDashboard(student) {
  const grade = (student.midterm * 0.4) + (student.final * 0.6); // Logic repeated
  console.log(`Welcome, ${student.name}. Your grade is ${grade.toFixed(1)}`);
}

function sendGradeReport(student) {
  const grade = (student.midterm * 0.4) + (student.final * 0.6); // Logic repeated
  console.log(`Sending report for ${student.name} with grade ${grade.toFixed(1)}`);
}
```

```javascript
// --- GOOD: DRY Code ---
function calculateGrade(student) {
  return (student.midterm * 0.4) + (student.final * 0.6);
}

function displayStudentDashboard(student) {
  const grade = calculateGrade(student);
  console.log(`Welcome, ${student.name}. Your grade is ${grade.toFixed(1)}`);
}

function sendGradeReport(student) {
  const grade = calculateGrade(student);
  console.log(`Sending report for ${student.name} with grade ${grade.toFixed(1)}`);
}
```
