That's a brilliant question. It shows you're already thinking about the bigger picture: "If ACID is for one type of system, what about the others?" You're right, not all databases follow the strict ACID model, and they have their own set of principles for a very good reason.

Let's get into it.

### The World Beyond Relational: NoSQL and the Need for Something Else

First, why do non-relational (often called NoSQL) databases even exist?

Think about the difference between a local bank and a global social media platform like Instagram.
*   **The Bank (ACID):** Needs absolute correctness. A single lost transaction is a disaster. It can afford to be a little slower or even temporarily unavailable to guarantee that every penny is accounted for.
*   **Instagram (Not ACID):** Needs massive scale and to always be available. If you post a photo, it needs to work for you in New York and your friend in Tokyo at the same time. Is it a disaster if your friend sees your "like" 2 seconds after you click it? No. Is it a disaster if the entire platform goes down because two data centers can't sync perfectly? Yes.

This trade-off—sacrificing perfect, instant consistency for massive availability and scale—is the reason NoSQL databases were born. This leads us to a fundamental concept that governs these systems.
