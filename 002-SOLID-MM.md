# ðŸ§± SOLID Principles (For Object-Oriented Design)
- ## S - Single Responsibility Principle
  - **Concept**: A class should have only one reason to change.
  - **Motto**: "One Job Per Class."
  - **Analogy**: A Swiss Army Knife (each tool has one purpose).

- ## O - Open/Closed Principle
  - **Concept**: Open for extension, closed for modification.
  - **Motto**: "Add New Features Without Changing Old Code."
  - **Analogy**: A Power Strip (you plug in new devices, you don't rewire it).

- ## L - Liskov Substitution Principle
  - **Concept**: Subclasses must be substitutable for their parent classes.
  - **Motto**: "A Subclass Should Behave Like Its Parent."
  - **Analogy**: The Duck Test (a toy duck isn't a real substitute for a duck).

- ## I - Interface Segregation Principle
  - **Concept**: Don't force clients to implement interfaces they don't use.
  - **Motto**: "Small, Specific Interfaces are Better than Fat Ones."
  - **Analogy**: Restaurant Menus (you get the drink menu, not the whole book).

- ## D - Dependency Inversion Principle
  - **Concept**: High-level code should depend on abstractions, not concrete details.
  - **Motto**: "Depend on Interfaces, Not Implementations."
  - **Analogy**: The Wall Socket (your laptop plugs into a standard socket, not directly into the power plant).
